Acceptance criteria
Using any programming language and libraries you would like:
An HTTP server is built to handle tree data structures. The server will expose two endpoints:
GET /api/tree - Returns an array of all trees that exist in the database
POST /api/tree - Creates a new node and attaches it to the specified parent node in the tree
A persistence layer is implemented within the HTTP server, e.g data is retained between server starts/stops
Testing is implemented ensure the server is behaving as expected
Hint: complete this challenge as a production API made available to other developers.
